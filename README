USAGE:

You should not need to do anything, the plugin should take care of adjusting the tab width and space/tab settings for each file as you edit them. The plugin assumes that either tabs, or spaces width a width of 2, 3, 4 or 8 is used. In the case of tabs, your local settings is used for the width to display.

You can see an entry in the status bar like "Auto Tab: (S2)" which shows what mode the current buffer is in. The first character will be either S for space or T for tabs, and the second will be the width.
